// Periodic autosave for in-progress field state. Today only the coverage
// map is persisted on the timer — that's the highest-value data because
// it's what drives the "this row is done" map paint and the operator
// can't reproduce it without re-driving the field. Tracks, tram lines,
// tram systems, and job metadata still only persist on CloseFieldAsync;
// crash recovery for those is follow-up work.
