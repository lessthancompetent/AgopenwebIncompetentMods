# Threading Migration Parking Lot

The single index of open decisions, deferred work, and cross-phase
follow-ups for the threading migration. Supplements
[THREADING_MIGRATION_PLAN.md](THREADING_MIGRATION_PLAN.md) and every
per-phase plan under `Plans/`.

---

## 1. Purpose

Per-phase plans intentionally *don't* resolve every open question — they
lock only what that phase needs to ship. Everything else gets parked
here so it can't fall through the cracks between phases.

Two failure modes this document exists to prevent:

- **Silent deferral.** A phase plan says "decided later" and "later"
  never arrives because no one remembers.
- **Silent creep.** A decision gets made ad hoc mid-phase without being
  traced back to the architectural concern that motivated it.

Every deferred item lives here with a **why**, a **who/when owns it**,
and a **dated review log**. Nothing gets dropped silently — items are
either resolved and archived (§5) or kept open with an explicit reason.

---

## 2. Review protocol

At the end of every phase, before the phase's PR merges:

1. Walk §4 (Open items) top to bottom.
2. For each open item, answer three questions:
   - **Did this phase surface new information that changes the answer?**
     If yes, update the "Why parked" field or move to §5 as resolved.
   - **Should this be resolved in the phase we're closing?**
     If yes, pull it into the current PR. A deferred item is
     cheaper to close when the relevant code is already touched.
   - **Does the next phase need this resolved before it can start?**
     If yes, the next phase's plan opens with "resolve TMP-NNN" as
     its first step.
3. Append a dated line to the item's review log, even if the answer is
   "still parked" — the log proves the item was considered, not
   ignored.

Review happens in the PR description, inline against the item IDs. A
merge without a parking-lot review is a convention violation; same
weight as merging without tests.

---

## 3. Entry shape

Every open item carries:

- **ID** — `TMP-NNN` (threading migration parking). Stable across the
  lifetime of the item — once assigned, never reused, even after
  resolution.
- **Title** — short phrase.
- **Status** — one of: `Open`, `In review`, `Resolved` (resolved items
  move to §5).
- **Raised in** — phase where the item was first deferred.
- **Decide by** — the phase where the item *must* be resolved, or
  `Optional` if it's a nice-to-have.
- **Source** — pointer to the originating discussion (parent plan
  section, per-phase plan section, conversation artifact).
- **Why parked** — the reason, concrete. Not "we'll figure it out" —
  "this becomes testable only when X exists" or "this depends on the
  shape of Y which isn't visible yet."
- **What the decision is** — the specific question to answer, phrased
  so someone walking in cold knows what they're choosing between.
- **Review log** — dated notes from each end-of-phase review.

---

## 4. Open items

### TMP-001 — Snapshot identity vs equality

- **Status:** Open
- **Raised in:** Phase A
- **Decide by:** Phase C (Commit 1, before `YouTurnSnapshot` is populated)
- **Source:** parent plan §6.1; Phase A plan §8

**Why parked.** Becomes a testable question only when the cycle worker
actually builds a `YouTurnSnapshot` every tick. In Phase A nothing
populates it, so there's nothing to construct or compare. The `record`
type chosen in Phase A Commit 2 supports either answer.

**What the decision is.** Either:
- (a) the cycle worker reuses list instances (e.g., `TurnPath`,
  `SnakeSequence`) when the state didn't change, so
  `SetProperty`'s reference check elides `PropertyChanged` firing, or
- (b) the `ApplyGpsCycleResult` path does value-equality checks before
  writing, letting the cycle worker build fresh snapshots every tick.

(a) is faster but forces the cycle worker to track instance identity
across ticks. (b) is simpler but spends cycles on equality checks on
the UI thread.

**Review log.**
- 2026-04-19 — Parked during Phase A planning. Type-level decision made
  (records) that keeps both paths open.
- 2026-04-19 (Phase A close) — Phase A ships `YouTurnSnapshot` and
  `GuidanceSnapshot` as records with `IReadOnlyList<T>?` for list fields,
  which supports either future approach. Still parked; Phase C owns.
- 2026-04-19 (Phase B close) — Phase B didn't populate snapshots; the
  `null`-valued fields on `GpsCycleResult` continue untouched. Still
  parked for Phase C C1.

---

### TMP-002 — Synchronous UI command carve-outs

- **Status:** Open
- **Raised in:** Phase A
- **Decide by:** Per migration phase (Phase C for YouTurn commands,
  Phase D for Guidance commands)
- **Source:** parent plan §6.3; Phase A plan §8

**Why parked.** Can only be answered by walking every UI command whose
current behavior writes to `State.*` and asking "is a ≤100 ms delay
(one cycle tick) visible to the user?" That inventory is
phase-specific: Phase C covers `TriggerManualYouTurn*`, `ClearYouTurnState`;
Phase D covers nudge / snap / reverse-heading. Phase A migrates nothing,
so the question has no subject.

**What the decision is.** For each migrated command, either:
- (a) it goes through the intent queue (default), accepting up to one
  tick of latency, or
- (b) it's added to an explicit carve-out list with a written rationale
  for why sub-tick latency is required.

Carve-outs are the only sanctioned bypass of the one-way flow.

**Review log.**
- 2026-04-19 — Parked during Phase A planning. No commands migrated
  yet.
- 2026-04-19 (Phase A close) — Still nothing migrated; no commands
  touched in Phase A. Phase C's plan must open with the carve-out
  inventory for `TriggerManualYouTurnLeft/Right` and `ClearYouTurnState`.
- 2026-04-19 (Phase B close) — Phase B migrated no UI commands.
  Still parked for Phase C (YouTurn commands) and D (guidance commands).

---

### TMP-005 — Removal of flat YouTurn / Guidance fields on `GpsCycleResult`

- **Status:** Open
- **Raised in:** Phase A
- **Decide by:** Phase C (for YouTurn fields) / Phase D (for Guidance
  fields)
- **Source:** Phase A plan §3 ("Out of scope")

**Why parked.** Phase A adds `YouTurnSnapshot? YouTurn` and
`GuidanceSnapshot? Guidance` to `GpsCycleResult` as new nullable fields.
Existing flat fields (`IsInYouTurn`, `YouTurnTriggered`,
`YouTurnCompleted`, `SteerAngle`, `CrossTrackError`, `GoalPointEasting`,
`GoalPointNorthing`, `HasGuidance`) remain for backward compatibility
so nothing breaks mid-migration. Removal happens when all consumers are
swapped to read the snapshot.

**What the decision is.** Confirm Phase C's final commit removes
YouTurn flat fields and Phase D's final commit removes Guidance flat
fields, not sooner (breaks mid-branch builds) and not later (leaves
dead fields in the snapshot).

**Review log.**
- 2026-04-19 — Parked during Phase A planning. Owned by Phase C / D
  explicitly in their plans.
- 2026-04-19 (Phase A close) — Flat fields on `GpsCycleResult` remain
  (`IsInYouTurn`, `YouTurnTriggered`, `YouTurnCompleted`, `SteerAngle`,
  `CrossTrackError`, `GoalPointEasting`, `GoalPointNorthing`,
  `HasGuidance`). New `YouTurn` / `Guidance` snapshot fields sit
  alongside them as `null` placeholders. No removal in Phase A; still
  parked.
- 2026-04-19 (Phase B close) — Flat fields still in place; `null`
  placeholders still unused. Phase C populates the YouTurn snapshot and
  removes the three flat YouTurn fields. Phase D does the same for
  Guidance.

---

### TMP-006 — Enforcement of "no direct `State.*` writes from services"

- **Status:** Open
- **Raised in:** Phase A (from parent plan acceptance criteria)
- **Decide by:** Optional — latest viable is Phase F (final
  whole-effort acceptance)
- **Source:** parent plan §7 ("Enforce via a Roslyn analyzer if
  practical, otherwise via grep in CI")

**Why parked.** Useful but not load-bearing for any phase to ship.
Enforcement matters at steady state to keep the invariant from eroding
— a Roslyn analyzer is the structural answer, a CI grep is the
pragmatic answer. Either works; neither needs to be in place before
Phases C or D prove the pattern. Worth doing once the pattern is
established, because the analyzer rules become unambiguous.

**What the decision is.** Roslyn analyzer (compile-time enforcement,
higher build cost, false-positive risk) vs CI grep (zero build cost,
can miss aliased writes). Or both.

**Review log.**
- 2026-04-19 — Parked during Phase A planning. No phase currently
  owns it.
- 2026-04-19 (Phase A close) — No services migrated in Phase A; the
  invariant has nothing to enforce yet. Still parked — revisit at the
  end of Phase C when the first migrated service exists.
- 2026-04-19 (Phase B close) — Phase B established more invariants to
  enforce: receive thread is parse-only, AutoSteerService holds no
  `_localPlane`, `NmeaParserService` deleted. The `UnifiedPipelineTests`
  (C6) enforce the first two at unit-test level but an analyzer or CI
  grep would catch structural drift earlier. Still parked.

---

### TMP-007 — `MainViewModel` line-count baseline

- **Status:** Open
- **Raised in:** Phase A (from parent plan acceptance criteria)
- **Decide by:** Before Phase C starts (its acceptance references the
  baseline)
- **Source:** parent plan §7 ("baseline captured before Phase C")

**Why parked.** The parent plan asserts `MainViewModel` partials'
total line count will drop measurably. That's only verifiable against a
recorded baseline. Capture is trivial — one `wc -l` over the
`MainViewModel.*.cs` files — but needs to happen before Phase C so the
number is real.

**What the decision is.** When and where to record the baseline.
Suggest: add a line to the parent plan §7 with the recorded number the
day Phase C's branch is cut; commit alongside the Phase C PR.

**Review log.**
- 2026-04-19 — Parked during Phase A planning. Trivial but will be
  forgotten if not tracked.
- 2026-04-19 (Phase A close) — **Baseline captured** at end of Phase A
  (same commit base Phase C will branch from): `MainViewModel.cs` =
  5,148 lines, 23 partial files totaling 14,136 lines overall.
  Notable per-phase targets:
  - `MainViewModel.YouTurn.cs` = 206 lines (Phase A acceptance target:
    under 100 lines after Phase C).
  - `MainViewModel.GpsHandling.cs` = 436 lines (Phase C removes the
    `YouTurnStateMachine.Tick` call from this file).
  Phase C's final commit compares against this baseline.
- 2026-04-19 (Phase B close) — Post-Phase-B snapshot: `MainViewModel.cs`
  = 5,139 lines (−9 from A; C3 removed `_nmeaParser` field,
  construction, and the NMEA-parse branch in `OnUdpDataReceived`).
  Total across 23 partials: 14,127 lines (−9). Phase C's reduction
  target is still measured against the 14,136 Phase-A baseline.

### TMP-008 — Manual U-turn does not execute when triggered

**Status:** Resolved as "works as designed, AgOpen-parity deferred"
(Phase C C1 investigation, 2026-04-19). Moved to §5 Resolved.

---

### TMP-009 — Fix-to-fix heading behavior change activates in Phase B

- **Status:** Open
- **Raised in:** Phase B C2 planning
- **Decide by:** Phase B C6 (acceptance smoke test) — if the behavior
  change is noticeable on real hardware, decide whether to keep,
  temporarily disable, or back out.
- **Source:** `Shared/AgValoniaGPS.Services/NmeaParserService.cs:209` —
  `ProcessHeading(gpsHeading, speedMs, gpsData.CurrentPosition.Easting, gpsData.CurrentPosition.Northing)`

**Why parked.** Today `NmeaParserService.ProcessHeading` is called with
`gpsData.CurrentPosition.Easting` / `Northing` that are both **0.0** at
that moment — UTM conversion runs later in `GpsService.TransformAntennaToPivot`,
after `ParsePANDA` returns. That means `CalculateFixToFixHeading` has
always computed `distance = sqrt(0² + 0²) = 0 < Connections.FixToFixDistance`
and returned `-1`, i.e. the fix-to-fix branch never fired in production.

When Phase B C2 moves `ProcessHeading` into the cycle worker, it will
be called with real local easting/northing from the post-conversion
stage. Fix-to-fix heading starts actually working. Users in single-GPS
mode (or dual-GPS below the switch speed) will see a heading source
they've never seen before:
- Single-GPS users: now get fix-to-fix heading above `Connections.MinGpsStep`
  instead of the raw NMEA heading. Likely more stable for most cases.
- Dual-GPS users at low speed: now get fix-to-fix instead of dual-antenna
  heading. Could swing the tractor if dual-antenna was more accurate.

**What the decision is.** After Phase B C6 smoke test, confirm whether
the activated fix-to-fix behavior is an improvement, a regression, or
imperceptible. If regression, options:
1. Disable fix-to-fix by defaulting `Connections.MinGpsStep` to a
   value that never triggers (matches current dead-code behavior).
2. Leave dual-GPS dominant at all speeds (remove the DualSwitchSpeed
   branch) — tracks legacy behavior.
3. Keep as-is — the code did what the config said it should, which
   is now honored.

**Review log.**
- 2026-04-19 — Discovered while planning Phase B C2's fusion extraction.
  Parker decided to port `ProcessHeading` faithfully (with correct
  inputs) rather than preserve the 0,0 bug. The cycle worker passes
  real local easting/northing. Smoke test reveals behavior impact.
- 2026-04-19 (Phase B close) — Phase B smoke test on simulated GPS
  driving showed no visible regression. **Real-hardware verification
  pending.** Open until a user drives with real GPS and confirms
  heading behavior. If regression, switch `Connections.MinGpsStep`
  default to effectively-disabled or refactor `GpsHeadingFusionService`
  to gate fix-to-fix behind a config toggle.

### TMP-010 — UI freeze synchronised with tooltip balloon show

- **Status:** Open, not blocking Phase C.
- **Raised in:** Phase C C6 smoke test, 2026-04-20.
- **Decide by:** Post-threading-migration — investigated separately from
  the threading work since it is not caused by it.

**Symptom.** Mouse hovers over any button (sidebar, bottom bar, or
floating panel); after the normal tooltip delay, the balloon appears
and the entire UI stalls for a fraction of a second at the exact moment
the balloon shows. Dwell time before the balloon is smooth — only the
balloon-appearance frame freezes. Reproducible on every button,
independent of autosteer state, field open state, or session age
(happens on fresh launch).

**Why parked.** Tested on `develop` (commit `951865f`, pre-Phase-A)
using a git worktree on 2026-04-20. Freeze reproduces there too,
confirming this is a pre-existing Avalonia / tooltip-popup interaction,
not a threading-migration regression. Phase C adds more work to
`ApplyGpsCycleResult` (snapshot mirror) and more allocations per cycle
(TickContext, Position.With), which may make the freeze more or less
pronounced, but it is not the root cause — a pristine develop binary
with zero Phase-C code on the UI thread exhibits the same stall.

**Possible next-step investigations** (not to be done in-phase):
1. Run Avalonia with `LogRenderTiming` and `LogSendStateFrequency`
   diag flags while hovering; check whether the freeze is GC-induced
   (Gen2) or render/layout-induced (popup-root creation cost).
2. Compare against Avalonia 12 behavior — see `reference_avalonia12.md`
   in auto-memory; tooltip popup-root may be cheaper there.
3. Profile the popup-creation path with a managed profiler to see
   whether the cost is in resource resolution, font loading, or
   style application.

**Review log.**
- 2026-04-20 — Reported during Phase C C6 smoke test. Initial
  hypothesis: `_mapService.Set*` unconditional calls in the YouTurn
  snapshot mirror flooding `SendStateToHandler`. Added reference-
  equality gating speculatively; freeze persisted. Tested `develop`
  baseline via worktree — freeze reproduces there. Hypothesis
  falsified; gating change reverted. Parked for post-migration
  investigation.

## 5. Resolved items

### TMP-003 — Phase B unified service name

- **Status:** Resolved (Phase B close, 2026-04-19)
- **Resolution:** Keeps the name `GpsPipelineService`. Phase B expanded
  its responsibilities (absorbed AutoSteer cycle work, fusion, and
  fix-quality validation) but "pipeline orchestration" still fits. Any
  cosmetic rename deferred until post-Phase-F if still desired.
- **Decided in:** Phase B plan §2.1
- **Closing PR:** #259 (Phase B commit range `5d6bccd..d04bfc6`)

### TMP-004 — `UdpGpsQueue` introduction

- **Status:** Resolved (Phase B close, 2026-04-19)
- **Resolution:** Keep the existing `GpsDataUpdated` event + `Task.Run`
  handoff. Real-hardware smoke test on the AiO board over UDP showed
  autosteer engaged and held through the full drive, 60 FPS avg, no
  cycle back-pressure drops, and latency display updating at GPS
  cadence (after the rejection-gate fix in `9fe4dc9`). An explicit
  `Channel<Position>` would be overhead with no observable benefit.
  Reopen only if a future phase's cycle work lengthens enough to miss
  GPS ticks — the §0 invariant and existing `Interlocked` back-pressure
  remain in place either way.
- **Decided in:** Phase B plan §2.2; validated by real-hardware smoke test
- **Closing PR:** #259 (Phase B commit `9fe4dc9`)

### TMP-008 — Manual U-turn does not execute when triggered

- **Status:** Resolved as "works as designed, AgOpen parity deferred"
  (Phase C C1 investigation, 2026-04-19)
- **Resolution:** Original Phase A smoke-test symptom ("tractor didn't
  execute the turn") was misread. The tractor **does** execute the
  manual U-turn; the visual offset the user reported came from clicking
  the manual-trigger button before the tractor had settled on the
  magenta pass line — the generated path anchors at the tractor's
  current position, producing entry/exit legs offset from the visible
  tracks by the tractor's cross-track error at click time.
  Diagnostic logging (commit stripped in Phase C C1) confirmed path
  coordinates are mathematically consistent within 0.001m.

  Reference behavior in AgOpenGPS-original differs in two ways: (a) it
  plots an **immediate** Dubins-like arc at the tractor's current
  position rather than a headland-based entry-arc-exit, and (b) the
  guidance line visually shifts to the new post-turn pass. That's not
  a bug in AgValoniaGPS — it's a missing feature. Tracked as a real
  feature request, not a threading-migration blocker:
  - [Issue #260 — Manual U-turn: immediate turn at tractor position
    (AgOpen parity)](https://github.com/AgOpenGPS-Official/AgValoniaGPS/issues/260)
    (GitHub project "AgValoniaGPS", Planning column)
  - [Issue #261 — Free-drive: guidance line follows the tractor](https://github.com/AgOpenGPS-Official/AgValoniaGPS/issues/261)
    (same project, Planning column)

  Phase C C2 proceeds on the existing manual-U-turn behavior; the
  threading migration is independent of which path-generation
  algorithm the manual trigger uses.
- **Investigated in:** Phase C C1 (2026-04-19)
- **Closing PR:** #259 (diagnostic logs stripped, no code fix)
