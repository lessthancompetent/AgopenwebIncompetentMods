/// Lookahead invariant fence for the YouTurn pure-pursuit goal point.
///
/// User-reported symptom: while a U-turn is being followed, the tractor
/// "drives over the goal point" — meaning the visible distance from the
/// pivot to the rendered goal collapses, the controller has nothing to
/// chase, and steering accuracy drops.
///
/// Pure pursuit's contract is that the goal stays at the configured
/// lookahead distance ahead of the pivot. This fixture asserts that
/// invariant on representative geometries:
///
///   1) Straight path — Distance(goal, pivot) ≈ GoalPointDistance.
///   2) Tight U-turn arc — Distance(goal, pivot) stays at least half the
///      lookahead (allowing for path-curvature shrink — pure pursuit walks
///      along-path, so euclidean distance is bounded below by the chord
///      length, which approaches half the arc length on a half-circle).
///   3) Pivot advances → goal advances forward (positive dot product with
///      the local path forward direction).
///
/// If the underlying math regresses such that the goal closes on the
/// pivot (the user's symptom), one of these assertions fails and points
/// at the offending case.
